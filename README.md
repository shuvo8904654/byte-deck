<h1>Byte-Deck</h1>

<p>
Byte-Deck is an 8-key macropad I made mainly to learn more about keyboards and small PCBs.
It uses the Seeeduino XIAO RP2040 and has magnetic switches, an OLED, and a rotary encoder.
I'm using it for shortcuts and also for osu! because I wanted something small and fast to tap on.
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
This was my first time trying to build a macropad from scratch.
I wanted something simple but still useful, so I added an OLED and a knob.
The magnetic switches feel nice and the hot-swap sockets make it easy to replace them.
I learned a lot while making the PCB and case. Some parts were confusing at first,
especially wiring and footprints, but things made more sense as I continued working on it.
